This defines how the game board and its fields are set up.
The names of the parts are the correspondent class names.

Field
=====
- A type of Monopoly board field, like street or "action" fields
 (go to jail, ...)
- created once, constant, unique
- abstract methods 'onLand()' and 'onPass()' that are executed by the games
  main routine and must be implemented by different field types (classes)
* Class properties: immutable

PlanElement
===========
- Encapsulates a 'Field' with a "previous" and "next" pointer to other
  'PlanElement's
- Can be linked with other 'PlanElement's by setting 'prev' and 'next'
	--> beginning of chain has 'prev==null', end has 'next==null'
* Class properties: linking cannot be changed

PlanElementBlock
================
- a helper class to build 'PlanElement' chains easily

GameBoard
=========
- Has ancors for first and last 'PlanElement' (chain of fields does not
  necessarily have to be a circle)
- 'PlanElement's can be added with a function taking EITHER a 'PlanElement'
  as parameter -
  if it is linked to other PlanElements, the whole chain is added
  OR a 'PlanElementBlock' so the included 'PlanElement's are added.
  In both ways the 'PlanElement's are copied - so chains are reusable.
