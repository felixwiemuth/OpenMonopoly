This defines how the game board and its fields is set up.
The names of the parts are the correspondent class names.

Field
=====
- A type of Monopoly board field, like street or "action" fields (go to jail, ...)
- created once, constant, unique
- abstract methods 'onLand()' and 'onPass()' that are executed by the games
  main routine and must be implemented by different field types (classes)

PlanElement
===========
- Encapsulates a 'Field' with a "previous" and "next" pointer
- Can be linked with other 'PlanElement's by setting 'prev' and 'next'
	--> beginning of chain has 'prev==null', end has 'next==null'
	--> static function planned to undertake this task

PlanElementBlock
================
- Saves a chain of 'PlanElement's by keeping the 'begin' and 'end' point
  ('begin' = first 'PlanElement', 'end' = last 'PlanElement'
- created once, constant, unique
- Are used to add pre-defined groups of 'PlanElement's to the board
	--> static function copies the 'PlanElement's of the read-only
		'PlanElementBlock's

GameBoard
=========
- Has ancors for first and last 'PlanElement' (chain of fields does not
  necessarily have to be a circle)
