An 'InstructionCycle' defines the order of steps that are
repeatedly executed during the game.
What is done during a step is defined in 'Module's.
'InstrcutionCycle's can be nested into eachother,
for example you have a "Game" cycle which defines the steps of
a whole came, in this cycle another cycle "Round" defines how a
game round works etc. ("Round" is then executed by the "Game cycle").
Each implemented 'InstructionCycle' should define a correspondent interface
including the needed methods which the 'Module's should implement.
